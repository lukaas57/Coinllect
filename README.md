# Coinllect

Game made in Python using Pygame
Collect as much coins as you can while avoid spikes.

## 🎮 How to Play Coinllect:
	- The game starts when any key is pressed.
	- Your goal is to collect coins while avoiding spikes.
	- Use the arrow keys to move.

## ⚙️ Game Mechanics:
	- Every time you collect a coin, you become invulnerable for 0.5 seconds.
	- This invulnerability can stack up to 3 seconds total.
	- For every 5 coins, a new spike appears randomly on the screen.
	- Once you reach 20 coins, a potion starts spawning every 10 coins.
	- Picking up a potion gives you:
		- 3 seconds of increased movement speed
		- 3 seconds of invulnerability
	- At the bottom of the screen, you can see how much invulnerability time you have left.
